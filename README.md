This is a replacement for Hastebin in Rails. You can fire up an instance by cloning this repo and running the docker-compose.yml.

I intend to make this service's branding less personal and work on the appearence a bit. I also plan to make this service more configurable and make self-hosting it easier, though all of those things will be saved for later. The most important thing for me was getting this out of the door so I could use it, my Hastebin instance died.
